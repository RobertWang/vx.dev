# Quick Start

## Setup Repository Secrets

Users can start by creating their own vx.dev repository based on the current template repo. In the repository's [`settings -> secrets and variables -> actions`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) section, the following repository secrets need to be set up:

- `GH_TOKEN`: This should be a Github Personal Access Token with repo scope permissions. [How to create one?](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: This is an OpenAI API key. [How to create one?](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup)
- `WHITELIST`: A list of GitHub usernames allowed to use vx.dev, separated by commas. Only issues and comments created by users in the WHITELIST will be responded to by vx.dev, ensuring API usage safety.

## Create An Issue

Once set up, users can create issues to describe their requirements. Issues labelled with `ui-gen` will trigger vx.dev to create a PR, including the code generated by vx.dev.

Users can modify the issue description or iterate on the UI requirements through comments in the issue or PR. All these information will be incorporated into vx.dev's prompt.

Under the hood, vx.dev use Github Actions to create a workflow, so you can debug by reviewing the workflow logs.

## Preview UI

vx.dev includes a preview UI feature. In the template repository, we continuously deploy via Cloudflare Pages to preview the generated UI results. Alternatively, other service providers can be used for this process.
